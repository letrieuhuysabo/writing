            Dear ABC company,
<br/><br/>
I hope this email finds you well.
<br/><br/>
I have looked at your holiday website for cruises. I am writing to request more information about your cruise.<br/><br/>
First of all, could you provide me with more information about how long the cruise lasts. I would be grateful if the cruise lasts a week. Knowing the length of the cruise will help me plan accordingly.
<br/><br/>
My second question is about where and when the cruise starts and ends. The website says the cruise will start in early September, but I would also like the exact dates of the cruise. Could you inform me as soon as they come available ? Understanding these details will assist me in making travel arrangements.
<br/><br/>
My third question is about the cost of a cabin. I would like to know if you have a variety of cabins with different prices. Could you confirm if there are any special packages or discounts available? I would also know more about payment method.
<br/><br/>
Thank you in advance for your assistance. If you require any further information from me, please do not hesitate to request.
<br/><br/>
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
<br/><br/>
Best regards,
<br/><br/>
Le Trieu Huy

            One of my favorite website is https://www.pixilart.com.
<br/><br/>This website provides users with the tools to create amazing drawings. This is a great place for designers and artists to create drawings full of personality and creativity. The best thing about this website is that it can help users draw single frames and stitch them together to create animations. Another good point is that users are provided with tools to draw from simple shapes such as straight lines to complex shapes such as circles, as well as a diverse color palette to coordinate details together. At the same time, you can also share drawings if you want.
<br/><br/>However, this website is quite difficult to use for newbies It also requires good drawing ability of users. This website also has much advertising.Sometimes when you're drawing, ads will appear and obscure the part you want to see, which is very annoying.
<br/><br/>In summary, this website is a good place for your drawing hobby. I recommend you to use it.
